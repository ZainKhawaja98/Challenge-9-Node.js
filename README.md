# challenge-9-Node.js

## Description
This project allows someone to make a high quality readme by filling in the information. I was motivated to make this since every project requires a readme file so this will make it easier to generate one with everything I need. This will solve the problem of having to copy and paste the skeleton of the readme from the prework assignment. I learned how to use npm tools like inquirer.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
Open a new terminal and go to the develop folder. Type node index.js and fill in all the questions and a readme will be generated in the output folder.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
